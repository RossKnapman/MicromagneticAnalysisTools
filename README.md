 # MicromagneticAnalysisTools

Code I use for analysing data from MuMax3. Please see the documentation [here](http://micromagneticanalysistools.readthedocs.io/).

## TODO

- Delete redundant functions e.g. COM calculation that does not go to a comoving frame
- Skyrmion calculations with `findiff` rather than naive discretisation
