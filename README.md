 # MicromagneticAnalysisTools

Code I use for analysing data from MuMax3.


## TODO

- Allow simultaneous plotting of quiver and colour
- Delete redundant functions e.g. COM calculation that does not go to a comoving frame
- Some functions (e.g. `vecToRGB`) should be moved to a separate `utils.py` directory
- 'Proper' docstrings
- Skyrmion calculations with `findiff` rather than naive discretisation
- Sphinx documentation
