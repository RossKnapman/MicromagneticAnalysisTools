 # MicromagneticAnalysisTools

Code I use for analysing data from MuMax3.


## TODO

- [x] Write unit tests
- [x] Refactor code so that code with the same functionality is not duplicated
- [ ] Some functions (e.g. `vecToRGB`) should be moved to a separate `utils.py` directory
- [ ] 'Proper' docstrings
- [ ] Skyrmion calculations with `findiff` rather than naive discretisation
- [ ] Write `setup.py`
- [ ] Sphinx documentation
- [ ] Integration testing
