 # MicromagneticAnalysisTools

Code I use for analysing data from MuMax3.


## TODO

- [x] Fix plot colour bug for HSV colours
- [-] Fix animation bug where it doesn't move
- [-] Fix bug where first frame is appended to animation
- [ ] Delete redundant functions e.g. COM calculation that does not go to a comoving frame
- [ ] Some functions (e.g. `vecToRGB`) should be moved to a separate `utils.py` directory
- [ ] 'Proper' docstrings
- [ ] Skyrmion calculations with `findiff` rather than naive discretisation
- [ ] Sphinx documentation
- [ ] Integration testing
